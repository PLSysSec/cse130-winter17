This course will cover basic concepts and design tradeoffs related to
programming languages. The first half of the course focuses on functions,
types, scope, storage management, exceptions, and continuations. The second
half covers object-oriented features and concurrency. We will conclude with a
few special-topics in programming languages. The class also has a number of
small labs where students get to implement some of the language features
discussed in class.
