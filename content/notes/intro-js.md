### Recommended reading

If you have not worked with JavaScript before, take some time to familiarize
yourself with the basics of the language, as most of the labs in this class
will be in JavaScript.

We recommend the <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide">Mozilla
Developer Network's JavaScript Guide</a>,
but there are many other tutorials on the Internet.

Dave Herman's <a href="http://effectivejs.com/">Effective JavaScript</a> is
very good reference that covers a lot of the JavaScript intricacies.  You will
not this for the class, but if you end up writing JavaScript code in the
outside world, this book is must-read.
