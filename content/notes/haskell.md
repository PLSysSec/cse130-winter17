### Lecture slides and code

You can get the slides [here](../../slides/hs-nutshell.pdf). The slides refer
to a Haskell source file, which you get at [here](../../code/intro.hs).

### Assigned and recommended reading

In addition to the <a href="../../book/ch05.pdf">assigned reading</a> you may wish to look at Brent Yorgey's
lectures on School of Haskell, for example [Haskell
Basics](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/starting-with-haskell/introduction-to-haskell/1-haskell-basics)
is a great start. For those interest in the history of Haskell, 
[A history of Haskell: Being lazy with class](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1238844.1238856) is a fantastic read,
and there is a similarly engaging [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06x8Wf2r2Mc).
