The course consists of lectures, written homeworks, and programming
assignments.  The goal of the course is to **(1)** familiarize you with various
modern programming language concepts and paradigms and **(2)** get you to think
about and understand the design trade-offs and implementations of different
language features. We will use real-world languages (e.g., JavaScript, Haskell,
and C++) to explore the different concepts. But, we will not cover any one
language in full -- this course is not meant to make you a proficient
programmer, learning how to proficiently program in any of these languages is a
course in of itself.


#### Grading

-  5% Participation/pre-lecture readings
- 25% Homework and programming assignments
- 35% Midterm exam
- 35% Final exam

###### Participation/pre-lecture readings

Before each class there will be some assigned reading. You are expected to do
the reading and have at least a vague understanding of the concepts that will
be discussed in class. This will allow us to spend the lecture time to solidify
your understanding.  Asking and answering questions in class, on Piazza, or
during office hours counts towards your class participation. 

###### Homework and programming assignments

We will have weekly assignments, either in the form of written homeworks or
programming assignments. These assignments are meant to both reinforce your
knowledge of the concepts covered in lecture and get you to think beyond
lecture (e.g., if you were tasked with designing a new language).

###### Midterm exam

The exam will be held sometime in the middle of the quarter, in class. The
midterm is **closed-book**, but you may use a double-sided cheat sheet
(letter-size).

###### Final exam

The exam will be held on **TBD** in **TBD**. You **must** take the exam at this
time and location.  The final is **open-book**.
