The course consists of lectures, written homeworks, and programming
assignments.  The goal of the course is to **(1)** familiarize you with various
modern programming language concepts and paradigms and **(2)** get you to think
about and understand the design trade-offs and implementations of different
language features. We will use real-world languages (e.g., JavaScript, Haskell,
and C++) to explore the different concepts. But, we will not cover any one
language in full -- this course is not meant to make you a proficient
programmer, learning how to proficiently program in any of these languages is a
course in of itself.


#### Grading

-  5% Participation/pre-lecture readings
- 25% Homework and programming assignments
- 35% Midterm exam
- 35% Final exam

###### Participation/pre-lecture readings

Before each class there will be some assigned reading. You are expected to do
the reading and have at least a vague understanding of the concepts that will
be discussed in class. This will allow us to spend the lecture time to solidify
your understanding.  Asking and answering questions in class, on Piazza, or
during office hours counts towards your class participation. 

###### Homework and programming assignments

We will have almost weekly assignments, either in the form of written homeworks
or programming assignments. These assignments are meant to both reinforce your
knowledge of the concepts covered in lecture and get you to think about PL beyond
lecture (e.g., if you were tasked with designing a new language).

You are expected to work on assignments in groups of 3. All written homework
must be typeset and submitted as a PDF using the online submission tool.
All assignments must be submitted as a group.

If you consult anything (books, academic papers, internet resources, people not
in your group) note this on your assignment submission. We encourage outside
learning but expect you to not seek out specific details about a solution --
anything submitted should be considered your own work. Similarly, you are
expected to not publish or otherwise share you solutions at any point (even
after the class is over).

If you are unsure about what is allowed, please ask the course staff.


###### Exams

The midterm exam will be held on **February 22**, in class. The midterm is
**closed-book**, but you may use a double-sided cheat sheet (letter-size).

The final exam will be held on **March 22** in **TBD**. You **must** take the exam at
this time and location.  The final is **closed-book**, but you may use 2
double-sided cheat sheets (letter-size).

The exams will make up 70% of your grade and is calculated as: 

```
max( midterm > 0 ?  final : 0, (midterm + final) / 2)
```

This means that (1) you basically get a second chance if you don't so well on
the midterm and (2) you must show up to both the midterm and the final.  If you
need to miss either exam because of a documented medical emergency, contact the
instructor immediately.
