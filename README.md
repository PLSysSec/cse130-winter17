This is the repo for the [CSE 130](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/cse130-winter17) course, using
[hugo](https://gohugo.io).

To clone this repo and build the site:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PLSysSec/cse130-winter17.git
hugo
```

Use `hugo server` if you want to run the local server. You may need to remove the `baseurl` and `canonifyurls` from the `config.toml` file for this to actually work.
